# Multithreading Productive Session for Java Students
 

Welcome to the repository for our Multithreading Productive Session for Java Students! In this session, we explored key concepts related to multithreading in Java, covering topics such as processes, threads, multitasking, CPU architecture, cache levels, visibility problems, and creating threads in Java.

## Session Highlights

### Understanding Multithreading

- **Processes vs. Threads:** Learn about the fundamental difference between processes and threads in the context of concurrent programming.

- **Multitasking vs. Multithreading:** Explore the concepts of multitasking and multithreading and understand how multithreading can enhance program efficiency.

- **CPU and Cores:** Dive into central processing units (CPUs), cores, and how multithreading takes full advantage of multi-core CPUs.

- **Cache Levels:** Explore CPU cache levels (L1, L2, and L3) and their impact on memory access speed.

- **Visibility Problem:** Understand the visibility problem in multithreading and strategies to ensure data consistency.

### Creating Threads in Java

- **Creating Threads:** Learn how to create threads in Java using both the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface, giving you flexibility in defining and launching threads.

- **Runnable Objects:** Understand the importance of the `Runnable` interface and implement tasks as runnable objects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code and exercises from our session, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bootcoding-developer/bootcoding-multithreading.git
   ```

2. Explore the code examples and exercises in the repository.

3. Feel free to modify, experiment, and enhance the code to deepen your understanding of multithreading concepts.

## Further Learning

- Experiment with multithreading concepts in your own projects to gain practical experience.

- Dive deeper into advanced multithreading topics, such as thread pools, concurrency frameworks, and the `java.util.concurrent` package.

- Collaborate on open-source projects or with peers to apply multithreading knowledge in real-world scenarios.

- Stay informed about the latest developments in Java and multithreading through books, blogs, and online courses.
